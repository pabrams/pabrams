**pabrams/pabrams** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` appears on my GitHub profile.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some stuff, but the exact description of what I'm working on changes so often that if I were to write it here, I'd have to remember to update it several times a day, sometimes. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to live my life.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nurturing self-satisfaction.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: just email me, I guess. john.paul.abrams@gmail.com. Sometimes I'm watching it. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/etc.  They/them works, too. I usually refer to myself as "we". Or sometimes "that stupid jerk". 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Everyone wants the same thing.
